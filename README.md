# network_scanner

## 2/13/23
- Started by using chatGPT to reference how bash scripts are generally used and best place to start. I decided to write an inital script to scan my home network.
- Used my terminal to make a new folder and instead of using Ruby like I had been, I started a shell file (.sh) to begin writing bash.
- There was alot less code than I originally expected so I was able to get it in fairly quickly and start the tests. I wrote it to allow the results of the scan to be put in to a .txt file for it to be read easier by the user.
- Next, I decided I would like to automate the script to run every 24 hours. 
- Started looking in to ways I could automate and that lead me to learning about cron jobs and cron tables. This is the step I got stuck with and will be debugging this as my next step.
